# Kaggle-Stroke-Prediction

#### Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
This is orignially a group project developed in the ISyE6414 Regression Analysis course at GeorgiaTech. I modified the orignial code written by me and my teammate.
